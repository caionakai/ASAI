Professor: Sandro Renato Dias

## Where do I put my code?
There are two main folders: frontend and backend.

### For frontend files
Inside the **frontend/src** folder we have two more folders named: **CRM** and **ERP**, inside them you find folders with the name of the modules that must be developed. Feel free to create, update and delete files/folders inside your group's folder, but don't change files that are outside your group's folder! (ofc, package json can be modified)

### For backend files

Lucas will decide


## How do I submit my code?
Every group **must** create a PULL REQUEST from a branch.
